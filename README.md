# Relational Neural Descriptor Fields (R-NDF)
This is a modified implementation of R-NDF with some additional features, including

- Capturing a dataset for training a NeRF
- CPU-only support

Please see [OG_README.md](OG_README.md) for the original README file. The installation instructions are all there.
There may be other hacks you will need to do to get this version of the codebase working.
